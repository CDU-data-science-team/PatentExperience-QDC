## Patient Experience Qualitative Data Categorisation

This is the website for the NHS England (NHSE) Insight and Feedback Team funded Patient Experience Qualitative Data Categorisation (PatientExperience-QDC) project. This project is being conducted in partnership with the [Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust Clinical Decision Unit Data Science Team](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team).

The aim of this project is develop and test an innovative approach to free text analysis, to support better use of qualitative patient experience feedback gathered through the [NHS Friends and Family Test](https://www.england.nhs.uk/fft/).

There are three main elements to the project:

1. Creation of a dataset of free text patient feedback that has been labelled with themes, utilising a new [categorisation framework](framework/index.qmd) which has been developed by qualitative researchers at NHSE.

2. Pxtextmining: Development and training of [machine learning models](pxtextmining/index.qmd) to automatically categorise unlabelled patient feedback into the categories established in the categorisation framework.

3. Experiences Dashboard: Development of a [user friendly interface](dashboard/index.qmd) to enable the exploration of qualitative patient feedback.
